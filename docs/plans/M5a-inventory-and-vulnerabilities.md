# Implementierungsplan: M5a — Inventory and vulnerabilities (Fleet integration)

Status: Ready for implementation · 2026-10-07 · Author: architect
Basis: architecture v1.7 §15 (Fleet, A10), §4.1 (hostnames), §11.5 (mutual watch), §14 privacy table; concept F4, C9,
"Privacy by design" (negative list), ADR 0009; M4b (Debian packages in the artifact bucket, autoinstall)

Binding language: **MUST** / **MUST NOT** / **SHOULD** / **MAY**. M5 is split: **M5a** (this plan) brings Fleet,
fleetd, inventory and vulnerabilities; **M5b** brings update management (holds, schedules, immediate install) and
staleness alerts.

## 1. Goal
Every Paddock device runs fleetd/osquery; the portal shows each device's installed packages and matching
vulnerabilities, and fleet-wide views per package and per CVE — strictly per organization, with Fleet hidden behind
Paddock. Agent and fleetd watch each other.

## 2. Context
- Fleet free edition requires MySQL 8 and Redis. Its UI and admin API MUST NOT be reachable publicly; only the device
  endpoints `/api/osquery/*`, `/api/fleet/orbit/*` (and the fleetd update endpoints if fleetd needs them) are
  published under `fleet.<domain>` (architecture §4.1).
- Fleet has no organization concept in the free edition (ADR 0009): Paddock maps hosts to devices by hardware UUID
  and stores everything under the device's organization (RLS).
- The concept's negative list (binding): never collect executed commands, process lists, network connections,
  browser or application data, keystrokes, screen content, location.

## 3. Binding decisions
1. **Stack:** services `fleet` (image `fleetdm/fleet`, newest stable, pinned by digest — approved), `fleet-mysql`
   (`mysql:8.4`, approved), `fleet-redis` (`valkey/valkey:8`, the already pinned image — Fleet speaks the Redis
   protocol; if Fleet refuses Valkey, use `redis:7` pinned, approved as fallback, and record it). Fleet is initialized
   by a bootstrap script: admin user (secret file), an **API-only** user for Paddock (token in a secret file),
   global enroll secret (secret file), server settings below. Caddy publishes only the device paths under
   `fleet.<domain>`; any other path → 404 at the proxy.
2. **Data minimization (C9):** Fleet settings `features.enable_host_users = false`, `enable_software_inventory = true`;
   no scheduled queries, no query packs, no live queries by Paddock; activity webhooks off. Paddock defines **policies
   only** (pass/fail): they return a boolean per host, never row data. The bootstrap verifies the settings at every
   start (worker reconcile, decision 6) and resets drift.
3. **fleetd package:** built per Paddock agent release with `fleetctl package --type deb --fleet-url
   https://fleet.<domain> --enable-scripts=false --disable-open-folder ...` (image `fleetdm/fleetctl` pinned, approved)
   **without** an enroll secret, published into the artifact bucket like the agent packages (`packages/<version>/
   fleet-osquery_<fleetd version>_amd64.deb`, plus SHA-256). Fleet desktop is disabled (no tray UI); auto-updates of
   fleetd from Fleet's TUF server are **disabled** (Paddock delivers fleetd versions). If `fleetctl package` cannot
   disable updates or scripts, stop (S1).
4. **Bundle (schema v2, additive):** `inventory: {fleet_url, enroll_secret, package: {version, url_path, sha256}}`.
   The enroll secret is delivered in the signed bundle in plain text; rationale: it only allows enrolling a host into
   Fleet, Paddock ignores hosts it cannot map, bundles are fetched only by their device over TLS with presigned URLs.
   (HPKE encryption of bundle secrets stays a later improvement — record it in §12 of this plan's report.)
5. **Agent `inventory` reconciler:** install the fleetd package from `https://bundles.<domain>/<url_path>` (SHA-256
   checked, through the M4b.1 bounded apt/dpkg path), write the enroll secret to the path fleetd reads
   (`/opt/orbit/secret.txt`, 0600), ensure `orbit.service` enabled+active. fleetd and its paths become a protected area
   (concept protected areas item 3 already names `fleetd`). The agent watches `orbit.service`
   (`tamper.service_stopped {unit}`).
6. **Mapping and sync (worker):** every 5 minutes the worker pages through Fleet hosts changed since the last cursor
   (`ListHostsChangedSince`), maps `hardware_uuid` → device (unique per organization; ambiguous or unmapped hosts →
   metric `paddock_inventory_unmapped_hosts`, never stored), and for mapped hosts stores: OS version, osquery/fleetd
   version, last seen, software list, vulnerabilities, policy results. Removed software rows are deleted
   (`ON CONFLICT` upsert + delete-missing per device in one transaction). Fleet IDs only in
   `device_inventory_ref.external_id`.
7. **Entities** (organization-scoped, RLS): `device_inventory_ref(device_id PK, external_id, last_seen_at, os_version,
   fleetd_version)`, `installed_software(device_id, name, version, source, PRIMARY KEY(device_id,name,version,source))`,
   `vulnerability_finding(device_id, cve, software_name, software_version, cvss_score numeric null, severity
   text null, fixed_version text null, first_seen_at, PRIMARY KEY(device_id,cve,software_name,software_version))`,
   `inventory_policy_result(device_id, policy_key, passing bool, updated_at)`.
8. **Policies** (`server/internal/inventory/policies/*.sql`, pushed through the Fleet API by the worker, idempotent):
   - `paddock_agent_running`: `SELECT 1 FROM processes WHERE name = 'paddockd' AND path LIKE '/opt/paddock/agent/%';`
     (returns pass/fail only — a policy, not a process list; this distinction is documented in the privacy docs);
   - `disk_encrypted`: root on dm-crypt (osquery `block_devices`/`disk_encryption`);
   - `ntp_synchronized`: `timedatectl`-equivalent via osquery if available, else omitted.
   A failing `paddock_agent_running` for a device whose last Paddock check-in is older than 15 min raises audit
   `device.tamper_agent_not_running` (mutual watch).
9. **Admin API** (list contract everywhere): `GET /api/v1/devices/{id}/software` (search name; sort name, version),
   `GET /api/v1/devices/{id}/vulnerabilities` (filters severity; sort cvss, cve), `GET /api/v1/software` (aggregated:
   name, version, device_count; search; filter has_vulnerabilities), `GET /api/v1/vulnerabilities` (aggregated per
   CVE: severity, cvss, affected device count, fixed version; filters severity, cve search), `GET
   /api/v1/vulnerabilities/{cve}/devices`. Read-only; no audit events for reads.
10. **Portal:** device detail tabs *Software* and *Vulnerabilities*; top-level pages *Software* and
    *Vulnerabilities* (DataList); dashboard tile on the start page: devices with critical/high findings.
11. **Privacy documentation:** `docs/compliance/privacy.md` lists exactly what Paddock and Fleet collect (with Fleet's
    detail queries named) and the negative list; it states that policies return pass/fail only.

## 4. Non-goals
Update management, holds, immediate installs, staleness alerts (M5b); Fleet premium features; live queries; software
uninstall; Fleet UI access for anyone but platform operators via local port-forward (documented).

## 5. Steps
0. **M4c review follow-ups** (one commit each):
   a) Himmelblau's NSS module answers `getent passwd` for **any** name (synthesised entries). Audit every place where the
      agent or its package scripts decide "does this user exist / which UID" (sudo UID resolution, deny-list short
      names, local admin, session detection, postinst scripts) and make each one either use the local files
      (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`) or require an entry that Himmelblau marks as a real directory user. Document the
      result in `docs/operations/device-login.md`; add unit tests for the corrected spots. CHANGELOG `Fixed` if behaviour
      changes. **Amended 2026-11-10:** the synthesis also breaks the maintainer scripts of other packages; see
      "Amendment 2026-11-10" at the end of this plan.
   b) Dead man's switch: when the self-lock token is deleted (switch disabled), the agent removes its pending warnings
      (desktop notification state and `/etc/issue.d/80-paddock-dms.issue`) immediately, not only after the next bundle.
      Unit test.
1. Stack + bootstrap + Caddy restrictions + settings check. Gate F0: from outside, `fleet.<domain>/api/latest/fleet/*`
   and the UI return 404; device paths work.
2. fleetd package build into the release pipeline; agent `inventory` reconciler; bundle field. Gate F1 (both VMs, in
   parallel): fleetd installed from Paddock's package store, host enrolled, mapped to the device within one sync round.
3. Worker sync + entities + policies + mutual watch. Gate F2: stopping paddockd on a VM → `device.tamper_agent_not_running`;
   stopping orbit → `tamper.service_stopped`.
4. Admin API + portal + privacy doc. Gates F3: software and vulnerability lists per device and fleet-wide, isolation
   (acme never sees globex inventory), list contract; F4: an intentionally old package version on a VM
   (e.g. `apt install <pkg>=<older version>`) shows its CVE.
5. Regression from reset (acceptance, e2e, system tests on both VMs in parallel).
One commit per step.

## 6. Acceptance criteria
| # | Given / When / Then | Req. | Observed by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC1 | Given an enrolled device, then within 10 minutes the portal lists its installed packages and known vulnerabilities | F4 | Org admin |
| AC2 | Given two organizations, then neither sees the other's inventory, and Fleet's own UI/API is not reachable publicly | F10, ADR 0009 | Org admin, platform operator |
| AC3 | Given someone stops the agent or fleetd, then the other reports it | F9 | Org admin (audit) |
| AC4 | Given the privacy doc, then everything collected is listed and nothing from the negative list is collected | C9 | Auditor |

## 7. Stop conditions
S1 fleetd cannot be packaged without auto-update/scripts; S2 Fleet's free API lacks per-host software or
vulnerabilities; S3 Fleet cannot be configured to skip host-user collection; plus M0 §11 S2/S6/S7/S8.

## Amendment 2026-11-10 — the agent holds himmelblaud around its own package transactions (PDK-983; `decisions-alpha10.md` §45 and §47)

Binding language: **MUST** / **MUST NOT** / **SHOULD** / **MAY**. Tickets: PDK-983 (N1–N8), PDK-985 (N9). N1–N5,
N7 and N8 record the implementation of PDK-983 as reviewed at `a75204af`; N6 (the regular updates run) is decided by
§47 and not implemented at that commit.

### Why

Step 0a established that Himmelblau's NSS module answers `getent passwd` for any name, and made the agent and
Paddock's own package scripts decide from the local files. It missed the packages of others: Debian's `adduser`
and shadow's `useradd` ask NSS before they create an account. On an enrolled device, while `himmelblaud` runs and
has reached the identity provider, Himmelblau 4.0.8 returns a synthetic directory user for the new name (also for a
name in a foreign domain; groups are not synthesized), and the maintainer script fails: `adduser --system` with exit
13 "already exists, but is not a system user", `useradd` with exit 9. Measured on Ubuntu 24.04 and 26.04: the same
command succeeds before enrollment and with `himmelblaud` stopped. Every package that creates a system account is
affected (`flatpak` with `_flatpak`, database and other daemon packages). The row "Package scripts: no user or group
lookups" of `docs/operations/device-login.md` covers Paddock's own packages only.

Options: (a) `cn_name_mapping = false`: the bare name is still synthesized, and every directory user's name and home
change. (b) nsswitch order or `[NOTFOUND=return]`: `files` is first already; glibc cannot select a source by name.
(c) a `name_mapping_script`: changes the names and homes of existing users and cannot tell a system account from a
directory user. (d) a global dpkg hook that stops `himmelblaud`: also pauses logins for every apt run of anybody and
puts a new writer into the protected identity configuration. (e) an upstream option that synthesizes only full UPNs
of the tenant domain, then a pin bump. (f) a hold around the agent's **own** transactions.
**Decision: (f) for alpha.10, (e) as the fix** (maintainer decision §45). ADR 0019 and the pinned version are
**not** changed now; the pin bump, the rendered option and the removal of the hold follow with the upstream fix.

### N1 Vocabulary

- **Transaction** = one `apt-get` call with the verb `install`, `reinstall`, `remove`, `purge`, `upgrade`,
  `dist-upgrade`, `full-upgrade`, `autoremove` or `autopurge`, or one `dpkg` call with `-i`, `--install`,
  `--unpack`, `--configure`, `-r`, `--remove`, `-P`, `--purge` or `--triggers-only`. A call with `-s`, `--simulate`,
  `--just-print`, `--dry-run`, `--recon`, `--no-act`, `-d` or `--download-only`, `apt-get update` and every query
  are no transactions.
- **Hold** = the time `himmelblaud.service` is stopped by Paddock around one transaction.
- **Foreign stop** = `himmelblaud.service` inactive or failed without a hold.

### N2 The hold (`reconcile.NSSShield`, `agent/internal/reconcile/shield.go`)

1. Every transaction the agent process runs MUST run under the hold: the applier (login and Himmelblau packages,
   required and forbidden software, updates), fleetd, self-service installs and removals, and *Install now*
   (`reconcile.Shielded` wraps the `System` these receive). One hold at a time; transactions are serialized.
2. When `himmelblaud.service` is not active, the transaction runs without a hold and no event is emitted. A device
   without directory logins is not touched, and a stopped daemon is never started by the shield.
3. Order before the transaction, binding: write the marker `/var/lib/paddock/state/nss-shield.json` (mode 0600;
   action and start time); remove a stale safety timer; arm the safety timer (N3); `systemctl stop
   himmelblaud.service`. When the marker or the timer fails, the daemon is not stopped, the transaction runs with
   the daemon running and the outcome is `hold_failed`. `himmelblaud-tasks.service` is never stopped explicitly.
4. The restore (`systemctl start himmelblaud.service himmelblaud-tasks.service`) MUST run on every path: success,
   error, panic (which still propagates) and a cancelled context (it runs on its own context with a timeout of
   2 minutes).
5. **Maximum hold: 10 minutes** (`NSSShieldMaxHold`). When a transaction is still running then, the daemons are
   started while it runs, the fact is logged, and the outcome is `max_hold`. The transaction is not interrupted.
6. The marker is removed after the hold's event was emitted. The safety timer is cancelled only when the start
   succeeded; otherwise it stays armed.
   **Corrected 2026-11-10 (`decisions-alpha10.md` §48 point 2):** after a failed restore the marker is **kept**. The
   event with the outcome `restore_failed` is emitted once, and the marker records that it was. The agent retries
   the start at its next start and in every login reconciler pass, without a second event, and removes the marker
   and cancels the timer once the start succeeded. Reason: with the marker gone, a daemon that stayed down would
   look like a foreign stop and never be started again by the agent (N3.3, N5).

### N3 Recovery without the agent

1. **Safety timer:** the transient systemd timer `paddock-nss-shield-restore` (`systemd-run --unit=… --on-active=…
   --timer-property=AccuracySec=1s`) runs `systemctl start himmelblaud.service himmelblaud-tasks.service`
   **12 minutes** after the hold began (maximum hold plus `NSSShieldTimerGrace` of 2 minutes). It depends on nothing
   of Paddock, so a killed agent or supervisor cannot leave directory logins stopped.
2. **Marker recovery:** at its start, before the first pass, the agent calls `NSSShield.Recover`: a marker means a
   hold whose process died. The agent starts both daemons (the timer may have done so already), cancels the timer
   and reports the hold once with the outcome `recovered` (`restore_failed` when the start fails).
3. Without a marker a stopped `himmelblaud` is left alone (agent design contract 8, and N5).
4. A build with the tag `paddock_dev` uses 4 minutes and 1 minute (timer after 5 minutes) so that the system gate
   can wait for the timer. These values MUST NOT reach a release build.

### N4 One event per hold

- Device event `login.nss_shield` (`pkg/protocol`), audit code **`device.login_nss_shield`** (closed registry,
  outcome `success`), params `action` (the transaction, for example `apt-get install`), `duration_s`, `outcome`,
  `error`. Exactly one event per hold; a transaction without a hold (N2.2) emits none.
- `outcome`: `restored`, `max_hold`, `recovered`, `restore_failed` (the safety timer retries), `hold_failed`.
- No package names, no user names and no secrets in the params. `api/openapi/device.yaml` lists the event type; an
  older server refuses the batch like every earlier new event type (server-first upgrade order).

### N5 A foreign stop is reported, never repaired

- The login reconciler reports a foreign stop once per stop as the existing event `tamper.service_stopped`
  (audit code `device.tamper_service_stopped`, params `unit` = `himmelblaud.service`, `state` = `inactive` or
  `failed`), and again only after the daemon ran in between. No new audit code.
- It MUST NOT report the daemon while a hold of Paddock is in progress, and it MUST NOT start the daemon: a local
  administrator's stop around an installation (the documented workaround) is not undone, and the agent does not
  heal on its own initiative.
- The registry note of `device.tamper_service_stopped` in `server/internal/domain/audit/codes.go` MUST name
  `himmelblaud.service` as a covered unit that is reported only (§47; `docs/compliance/audit-codes.md` is
  regenerated).
- `/etc/himmelblau/`, PAM and NSS configuration are not written by the hold. Protected area 4 is unchanged.

### N6 The regular updates run (`paddockd updates run`; §47 point 1)

`paddockd updates run` is a process of its own (`osupdates.RunRegular`: `apt-get update`, then `apt-get
dist-upgrade`, and `dpkg --configure -a` after an interrupted installation). It is one of the agent's own
transactions and MUST run under the same hold. A second process changes three things, decided here:

1. **One hold per run**, around the `dist-upgrade` step with its `dpkg --configure -a` and retry, with the action
   `apt-get dist-upgrade`. `apt-get update` runs before the hold. N2.2–N2.6 and N3.1 apply unchanged, with the same
   marker, timer name and durations.
2. **Mutual exclusion between processes:** a hold is held under an exclusive `flock` on
   `/var/lib/paddock/state/nss-shield.lock`, taken before the check of N2.2 and released after the marker is gone. A
   process that finds the lock taken waits for it. The lock, not the marker, says that a hold is in progress.
3. **Recovery and tamper detection use the lock:** `NSSShield.Recover` (N3.2) takes the lock without waiting; when
   it is taken, another process holds and nothing is recovered. The agent MUST run the same check in every login
   reconciler pass, so that a hold whose process died is reported as `recovered` while the agent runs. The login
   reconciler (N5) treats a stopped daemon as held while the lock is taken or the marker exists.
4. **Event:** the updates process cannot emit device events. Under the lock, after its restore, it appends one
   record `{action, duration_s, outcome, error}` to the JSON array in
   `/var/lib/paddock/state/nss-shield-report.json` (mode 0600, atomic replace, at most 16 records, the oldest
   dropped) and removes the marker. The agent emits every record as `login.nss_shield` in its next pass, under the
   lock, and removes the file. N4's "exactly one event per hold" holds across both processes.
5. Effect: directory logins and screen unlocks wait during every regular updates run, at most 10 minutes per run.

### N7 Effect on users (binding content for the operator documents)

While the agent runs a transaction on a device with directory logins, **new logins and screen unlocks of directory
users wait** until the hold ends: seconds, minutes for large packages, at most 10 minutes per transaction. Running
sessions continue; local accounts, the managed local administrator included, are not affected. Offline logins wait
as well, because the daemon that serves them is stopped.

**Corrected 2026-11-10 (`decisions-alpha10.md` §48 point 1):** "running sessions continue" means that no session is
ended. During a hold directory users and groups may not resolve through NSS, by name or by ID. Observed effects in
a running session of a directory user: `ls -l` and `id` show numeric IDs in place of names, and `sudo` by a
directory user can fail until the hold ends. Local accounts and the managed local administrator resolve from the
local files and are not affected. The operator documents and RR-133 MUST say this in these terms. The effect is
confirmed by the logging step of the system gates on both VMs and recorded with PDK-983.

**Corrected 2026-11-11 (`decisions-alpha10.md` §52; replaces the correction of 2026-11-10 above):** the system
gates on both VMs show that the earlier correction went too far. While `himmelblaud` is stopped, a directory user
who is signed in on the device, or who has signed in there before (cached), still resolves by name and by UID. So
running sessions continue **and** their users keep resolving: `ls -l`, `id` and `sudo` in such a session behave as
without a hold. Only a directory user who has **never been seen on the device** may not resolve during a hold (for
example `id <user>` for such a name answers "no such user"). Local accounts and the managed local administrator are
not affected. The operator documents and RR-133 MUST say this in these terms.

### N8 Tests and gates (names as implemented in PDK-983)

- Unit, `agent/internal/reconcile/shield_test.go`: the call order of N2.3; restore on error, panic and cancel;
  maximum hold; the skip of N2.2; a failed restore keeps the timer; `hold_failed` stops nothing; `Recover` with and
  without a marker; the classification of N1; own hold against foreign stop in the login reconciler (reported once,
  never started, reported again after a restart). `agent_test.go` `TestRunRecoversNSSShield`;
  `devicereports_test.go` `TestLoginNSSShieldEvent`.
- N6 adds: two processes contend for the lock (the second waits and holds afterwards); `Recover` with the lock taken
  recovers nothing; a record file with two records yields two events and is removed; a dead holder is reported as
  `recovered` by a running agent.
- System gates: plan M13b, amendment 2026-11-10 (SV5, SV6, SV10, SV11). `TestIdentityGates` MUST stay green on both
  VMs, because the login reconciler changed. For N6: a regular updates run that installs a package creating a
  system account succeeds on an enrolled device and yields one `device.login_nss_shield`.
  **Corrected 2026-11-10 (`decisions-alpha10.md` §48 point 3):** that system gate for N6 is a ticket of its own in
  alpha.10 (PDK-988) and MUST be green before the release tag. Until it lands, the unit tests of N6 above carry the
  rule. PDK-983 is not blocked by it.

### N9 Open in PDK-985 (not decided here)

`paddockd supervisor-upgrade` (`dpkg -i paddock-supervisor`) and the uninstall helper run outside the agent process
and are **not** under the hold. PDK-985 decides whether they need it: the supervisor path only if its packages can
create a system account; the uninstall helper purges the Himmelblau packages itself. Until then RR-133 names them.

### Stop conditions

- The unit that runs `paddockd updates run` may not call `systemctl stop`/`start`, `systemd-run`, or write
  `/var/lib/paddock/state/` (sandboxing): stop and report, do not loosen the unit without a decision.
- Any need to write `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, `/etc/pam.d/` or `/etc/himmelblau/` for the hold.
- Any path on which the daemons are started without a marker, a lock or a report of Paddock's own.

### Residual risks and documents

- `docs/compliance/residual-risks.md`: **RR-133** (new, written with this amendment) and RR-07 (updated).
- `docs/operations/device-login.md`, section "Package installations pause directory logins" (PDK-983): N7, the
  bounds of N2.5 and N3.1, the event of N4, N5 and the workaround for a local administrator's own apt run
  (`systemctl stop himmelblaud.service` before, `systemctl start himmelblaud.service himmelblaud-tasks.service`
  after). PDK-983 adds the regular updates run to its list when N6 is implemented.
- `docs/operations/software.md`: "What the device does", "Self-service app", "Residual risks" (written with this
  amendment) and the troubleshooting row (PDK-983).
