# Implementierungsplan: M5a — Inventory and vulnerabilities (Fleet integration)

Status: Ready for implementation (after M4c) · 2026-10-07 · Author: architect
Basis: architecture v1.7 §15 (Fleet, A10), §4.1 (hostnames), §11.5 (mutual watch), §14 privacy table; concept F4, C9,
"Privacy by design" (negative list), ADR 0009; M4b (Debian packages in the artifact bucket, autoinstall)

Binding language: **MUST** / **MUST NOT** / **SHOULD** / **MAY**. M5 is split: **M5a** (this plan) brings Fleet,
fleetd, inventory and vulnerabilities; **M5b** brings update management (holds, schedules, immediate install) and
staleness alerts.

## 1. Goal
Every Paddock device runs fleetd/osquery; the portal shows each device's installed packages and matching
vulnerabilities, and fleet-wide views per package and per CVE — strictly per organization, with Fleet hidden behind
Paddock. Agent and fleetd watch each other.

## 2. Context
- Fleet free edition requires MySQL 8 and Redis. Its UI and admin API MUST NOT be reachable publicly; only the device
  endpoints `/api/osquery/*`, `/api/fleet/orbit/*` (and the fleetd update endpoints if fleetd needs them) are
  published under `fleet.<domain>` (architecture §4.1).
- Fleet has no organization concept in the free edition (ADR 0009): Paddock maps hosts to devices by hardware UUID
  and stores everything under the device's organization (RLS).
- The concept's negative list (binding): never collect executed commands, process lists, network connections,
  browser or application data, keystrokes, screen content, location.

## 3. Binding decisions
1. **Stack:** services `fleet` (image `fleetdm/fleet`, newest stable, pinned by digest — approved), `fleet-mysql`
   (`mysql:8.4`, approved), `fleet-redis` (`valkey/valkey:8`, the already pinned image — Fleet speaks the Redis
   protocol; if Fleet refuses Valkey, use `redis:7` pinned, approved as fallback, and record it). Fleet is initialized
   by a bootstrap script: admin user (secret file), an **API-only** user for Paddock (token in a secret file),
   global enroll secret (secret file), server settings below. Caddy publishes only the device paths under
   `fleet.<domain>`; any other path → 404 at the proxy.
2. **Data minimization (C9):** Fleet settings `features.enable_host_users = false`, `enable_software_inventory = true`;
   no scheduled queries, no query packs, no live queries by Paddock; activity webhooks off. Paddock defines **policies
   only** (pass/fail): they return a boolean per host, never row data. The bootstrap verifies the settings at every
   start (worker reconcile, decision 6) and resets drift.
3. **fleetd package:** built per Paddock agent release with `fleetctl package --type deb --fleet-url
   https://fleet.<domain> --enable-scripts=false --disable-open-folder ...` (image `fleetdm/fleetctl` pinned, approved)
   **without** an enroll secret, published into the artifact bucket like the agent packages (`packages/<version>/
   fleet-osquery_<fleetd version>_amd64.deb`, plus SHA-256). Fleet desktop is disabled (no tray UI); auto-updates of
   fleetd from Fleet's TUF server are **disabled** (Paddock delivers fleetd versions). If `fleetctl package` cannot
   disable updates or scripts, stop (S1).
4. **Bundle (schema v2, additive):** `inventory: {fleet_url, enroll_secret, package: {version, url_path, sha256}}`.
   The enroll secret is delivered in the signed bundle in plain text; rationale: it only allows enrolling a host into
   Fleet, Paddock ignores hosts it cannot map, bundles are fetched only by their device over TLS with presigned URLs.
   (HPKE encryption of bundle secrets stays a later improvement — record it in §12 of this plan's report.)
5. **Agent `inventory` reconciler:** install the fleetd package from `https://bundles.<domain>/<url_path>` (SHA-256
   checked, through the M4b.1 bounded apt/dpkg path), write the enroll secret to the path fleetd reads
   (`/opt/orbit/secret.txt`, 0600), ensure `orbit.service` enabled+active. fleetd and its paths become a protected area
   (concept protected areas item 3 already names `fleetd`). The agent watches `orbit.service`
   (`tamper.service_stopped {unit}`).
6. **Mapping and sync (worker):** every 5 minutes the worker pages through Fleet hosts changed since the last cursor
   (`ListHostsChangedSince`), maps `hardware_uuid` → device (unique per organization; ambiguous or unmapped hosts →
   metric `paddock_inventory_unmapped_hosts`, never stored), and for mapped hosts stores: OS version, osquery/fleetd
   version, last seen, software list, vulnerabilities, policy results. Removed software rows are deleted
   (`ON CONFLICT` upsert + delete-missing per device in one transaction). Fleet IDs only in
   `device_inventory_ref.external_id`.
7. **Entities** (organization-scoped, RLS): `device_inventory_ref(device_id PK, external_id, last_seen_at, os_version,
   fleetd_version)`, `installed_software(device_id, name, version, source, PRIMARY KEY(device_id,name,version,source))`,
   `vulnerability_finding(device_id, cve, software_name, software_version, cvss_score numeric null, severity
   text null, fixed_version text null, first_seen_at, PRIMARY KEY(device_id,cve,software_name,software_version))`,
   `inventory_policy_result(device_id, policy_key, passing bool, updated_at)`.
8. **Policies** (`server/internal/inventory/policies/*.sql`, pushed through the Fleet API by the worker, idempotent):
   - `paddock_agent_running`: `SELECT 1 FROM processes WHERE name = 'paddockd' AND path LIKE '/opt/paddock/agent/%';`
     (returns pass/fail only — a policy, not a process list; this distinction is documented in the privacy docs);
   - `disk_encrypted`: root on dm-crypt (osquery `block_devices`/`disk_encryption`);
   - `ntp_synchronized`: `timedatectl`-equivalent via osquery if available, else omitted.
   A failing `paddock_agent_running` for a device whose last Paddock check-in is older than 15 min raises audit
   `device.tamper_agent_not_running` (mutual watch).
9. **Admin API** (list contract everywhere): `GET /api/v1/devices/{id}/software` (search name; sort name, version),
   `GET /api/v1/devices/{id}/vulnerabilities` (filters severity; sort cvss, cve), `GET /api/v1/software` (aggregated:
   name, version, device_count; search; filter has_vulnerabilities), `GET /api/v1/vulnerabilities` (aggregated per
   CVE: severity, cvss, affected device count, fixed version; filters severity, cve search), `GET
   /api/v1/vulnerabilities/{cve}/devices`. Read-only; no audit events for reads.
10. **Portal:** device detail tabs *Software* and *Vulnerabilities*; top-level pages *Software* and
    *Vulnerabilities* (DataList); dashboard tile on the start page: devices with critical/high findings.
11. **Privacy documentation:** `docs/compliance/privacy.md` lists exactly what Paddock and Fleet collect (with Fleet's
    detail queries named) and the negative list; it states that policies return pass/fail only.

## 4. Non-goals
Update management, holds, immediate installs, staleness alerts (M5b); Fleet premium features; live queries; software
uninstall; Fleet UI access for anyone but platform operators via local port-forward (documented).

## 5. Steps
1. Stack + bootstrap + Caddy restrictions + settings check. Gate F0: from outside, `fleet.<domain>/api/latest/fleet/*`
   and the UI return 404; device paths work.
2. fleetd package build into the release pipeline; agent `inventory` reconciler; bundle field. Gate F1 (both VMs, in
   parallel): fleetd installed from Paddock's package store, host enrolled, mapped to the device within one sync round.
3. Worker sync + entities + policies + mutual watch. Gate F2: stopping paddockd on a VM → `device.tamper_agent_not_running`;
   stopping orbit → `tamper.service_stopped`.
4. Admin API + portal + privacy doc. Gates F3: software and vulnerability lists per device and fleet-wide, isolation
   (acme never sees globex inventory), list contract; F4: an intentionally old package version on a VM
   (e.g. `apt install <pkg>=<older version>`) shows its CVE.
5. Regression from reset (acceptance, e2e, system tests on both VMs in parallel).
One commit per step.

## 6. Acceptance criteria
| # | Given / When / Then | Req. | Observed by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC1 | Given an enrolled device, then within 10 minutes the portal lists its installed packages and known vulnerabilities | F4 | Org admin |
| AC2 | Given two organizations, then neither sees the other's inventory, and Fleet's own UI/API is not reachable publicly | F10, ADR 0009 | Org admin, platform operator |
| AC3 | Given someone stops the agent or fleetd, then the other reports it | F9 | Org admin (audit) |
| AC4 | Given the privacy doc, then everything collected is listed and nothing from the negative list is collected | C9 | Auditor |

## 7. Stop conditions
S1 fleetd cannot be packaged without auto-update/scripts; S2 Fleet's free API lacks per-host software or
vulnerabilities; S3 Fleet cannot be configured to skip host-user collection; plus M0 §11 S2/S6/S7/S8.
